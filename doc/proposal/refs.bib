	abstract = {Crowd counting and crowd density estimation methods are of great significance in the field of public security. Estimating crowd density and counting from single image or video frame has become an essential part of a computer vision system in various scenarios. In this paper, we comprehensively review the recent research advancement on crowd counting and density estimation. First of all, we introduce the background of crowd counting and crowd density estimation. Second, the traditional crowd counting methods are summarized. Third, we focus on reviewing the crowd counting and crowd density methods based on convolutional neural network (CNN) models. Next, we report and discuss the experimental results of a number of typical methods on benchmark datasets. Finally, we present the promising future directions of crowd counting and crowd density.},
